There are many things that confuse me about base Rimworld. Most of them I can find mods to fix them. Other times I fix them with my own mod. This case is the second one, just in case anyone wasn't sure.

Why does smoothed stone have a value attached to it? I get that balance wise, it's to make it more likely that raid strengths will match your strength, but I've never looked at a cave with smooth walls and thought "whoever lives here is clearly doing very well financially". I usually think "if I go in there I might accidentally brain myself on the first slope. Probably sooner", or "if I get attacked by a swarm of radioactive bats when I go in there, do I become batman or manbat?".

This mod reduces the values of smoothed stones from 18+ to 0. Is it balanced? Not really. It ends up nerfing raids in the long term if you prefer smoothed stone over constructed walls. Does it make more sense to me? Definitely.

Want to make some of your smooth walls have value still? The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1986348112]Smooth Walls[url] mod will allow you to replace the natural worthless ones with artificial worthy ones.
